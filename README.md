The project uses synthetic data for Playground competitions.
The goal is to strike a balance between having real-world data (with named features) and ensuring test labels are not publicly available.
This approach allows for hosting competitions with more interesting datasets.
The state-of-the-art in synthetic data generation has improved significantly since the Tabular Playground Series began two years ago.
The goal is to produce datasets that have fewer artifacts.
Feedback on the datasets for different competitions is welcome to continue improving them.
This is a machine learning model that uses LightGBM to classify data on employee attrition, using a training dataset and predicting on a test dataset. The code uses LabelEncoder to encode categorical features and StratifiedKFold for cross-validation.
